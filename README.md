Tucson UHI (Urban Heat Map) for July 2022. I also have to add credit for NASA AppEEARS - JPL Dr Josh Fisher and QGIS also WWW.Naturalearthdata.com for use of their open source shapefiles. This is only a tiny fraction of an UHI using the NASA ISS based EcoSTRESS instrument data. The map extends beyond the city limits of tucson and I have yet to learn how to make it a publicly accessible/scrollable interactive map as of yet. From 1 month of data I was able to extract roughly 8 Land Surface Temperature data files and a similar number of Thermal emissivity files. After thorough review and filtering for cloudless data etc. I ended up with Two UHI images at night that showed the tendency of Tucson's extensive use of tarmac and concrete to absorb heat on days higher than 100-107F and re-radiate this IR many hours (11) later. The first map shows a tiny portion of the Tucson basin centered between the Reid Park Zoo/DM Airbase and Tucson Airport.  (ECO2LSTE_001_SDS_LST_doy2022187063948_aid0001)  shows that at 5:23 AM local time Tucson is still reradiating the heat absorbed from a high of 107F at 4:53 PM the previous day (The LST in the asphalt covered areas of the city is radiating at 82.13F which is higher than the average air temperature on record at that exact time on that date. Also note the coolest temperatures are noted at the Reid Park Zoo which I will point out with my map notations. Local sun (new day) heating has not yet begun at the point this measurement was taken. I will verify this against data at 11:39 PM on 7/6/2022 where I can contrast the LST  eastern slopes of the Tucson Range to determine if they are relatively cooler. Also note that south of DM Air Base runway is undeveloped  and unpaved area that displays the general ambient temperature of the local sandy scrubland. Wind is 6MPH from the WNW. Local arroyos to the South of DMAFB and Tucson Airport may show cooler green due to overnight monsoonal rain cooling. BTW resolution is 70M/pixel much better than that available from ANY ESA satellite (MODIS).
